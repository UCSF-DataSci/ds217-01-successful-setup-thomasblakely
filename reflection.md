# Getting to Know You

Welcome to DS217! Please take a few minutes to introduce yourself by answering these questions. There are no right or wrong answers - we just want to get to know you better and understand what you're hoping to get from this course.

## 1. Who are you and what's your background?
[Tell us a bit about yourself - your field of study, professional background, interests, or anything else you'd like to share]

My name is Thomas Blakely, and I am a recent graduate from UCLA, where I majored in mathematics/economics & statistics and data science. Currently I am a graduate student in the Health Data Science master's program at UCSF, where I am interested in developing skills at the intersection of data science and pharmacology. In the future, I would like to pursue a PhD, and I am currently in the early stages of compiling a list of institutions and professors I am interested in working with. One interesting fact about me is that I dropped out of high school during my freshman year and never returned. 

## 2. What are you looking for out of this class?
[What do you hope to gain? Specific skills, knowledge, applications, career goals?]

The main skill I would like to get from this class is more experience with Git and the command line. While I am relatively familiar with Python from previous coursework and online tutorials, I've not used these two that often because they were never necessary for me to use. So really just developing that intuition of when and how to use these two things is my main goal in this course.

## 3. What are you most looking forward to or tentative about?
[What excites you about programming/data science? What concerns or uncertainties do you have?]

What excites me the most about data science is probably the variety of different projects you can do. While people tend to specialize in a particular subsection of data science, the skills developed in one domain can often be transferred to another section, which means I can always find projects to work on that interest me.

As for what I am most tentative or concerned about, I would be remiss if I didn't point out the tenuous state the healthcare industry currently is in, especially as it comes to pharmaceuticals. But who knows what the future holds? Here's hoping for the best.

## 4. Share something you enjoy!
[Drop a link to something you really enjoy - could be a website, article, video, project, hobby, book, podcast, or anything else you're into]

My friend and I have been sending a whole bunch of cat videos to each other over the past year. Here is one of the videos I find particularly amusing. Note that the video is on YouTube, accessible through the link: https://youtube.com/shorts/BnAMotPrY3U. On the other hand, you can also click on the cute cat to be taken directly to the video!
